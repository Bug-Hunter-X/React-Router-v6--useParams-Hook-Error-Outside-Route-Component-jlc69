In React Router Dom v6, attempting to access the `useParams()` hook outside of a component using the `Route` or `Routes` components will result in an error.  This is because `useParams()` relies on the routing context provided by those components.  Trying to use it in a sibling component or another unrelated component will lead to the error: `'useParams' hook was called outside of a router context.`
